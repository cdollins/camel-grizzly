# Welcome to the Apache Camel Grizzly Component Project 

## Overview

Apache Camel is a powerful Spring based Integration Framework.


Apache Camel can be used as a routing and mediation engine for the
following network framework projects:

    * Apache MINA
    * Jboss Netty

But if you want to use the Glassfish Grizzly Framework your out of luck
unless you write your own component. So, this project is here to solve
that problem and provide a Grizzly Camel Component.

## Build Instructions
I used [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) mostly for dependency management & package automation.

    $ mvn clean package
